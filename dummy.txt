TLDR: Soft layoffs

Stay away from #fidelityinvestments . Here’s my experience working here and hoping to save others from the same career detour. Reasons why it sucks:

1) silent layoffs- I’ve noticed pip behavior such as what goes on in big tech without big tech pay
2) speaking of pay it sucks- if you don’t make it to full vesting of 401k and other benefits (6 years) you’re being paid the same as working in a government or university job
3) wlb sucks - a week ago I worked a 17 hour day and worked the weekend before that supporting an install may have to work the week after thanksgiving supporting another install
4) lots of Indians - they come in 3 flavors here . Been here awhile, h1b, and off-shore. The former uses the later two and all flavors push non-Indians out.
5) not a technology company although they’re trying -Old tech like mainframe and broken agile implementation which they use to track your story points basically

I could go on but that should be enough reasons for most. All factors combine to form a sweatshop like environment

TLDR:  Shopify corporate culture

Oh where do I start…. biggest one for me is that the culture is dead, all of the things Shopify was known for in the work culture is gone. Then we had 2 layoffs and it appears we’re going through a silent layoff now. The team atmosphere is gone, it’s not a call of duty free for all
