TLDR: Soft layoffs

Stay away from #fidelityinvestments . Here’s my experience working here and hoping to save others from the same career detour. Reasons why it sucks:

1) silent layoffs- I’ve noticed pip behavior such as what goes on in big tech without big tech pay
2) speaking of pay it sucks- if you don’t make it to full vesting of 401k and other benefits (6 years) you’re being paid the same as working in a government or university job
3) wlb sucks - a week ago I worked a 17 hour day and worked the weekend before that supporting an install may have to work the week after thanksgiving supporting another install
4) lots of Indians - they come in 3 flavors here . Been here awhile, h1b, and off-shore. The former uses the later two and all flavors push non-Indians out.
5) not a technology company although they’re trying -Old tech like mainframe and broken agile implementation which they use to track your story points basically

I could go on but that should be enough reasons for most. All factors combine to form a sweatshop like environment

TLDR:  Shopify corporate culture

Oh where do I start…. biggest one for me is that the culture is dead, all of the things Shopify was known for in the work culture is gone. Then we had 2 layoffs and it appears we’re going through a silent layoff now. The team atmosphere is gone, it’s not a call of duty free for all

TLDR: Macbook pro M1 and M2 chip laptops too fragile to be laptop

The customer service representative gaslit me at the Apple store last week. When I have been researching the numerous, in the thousands, complaints about the very situation I am in.

My six month old 16 inch MacBook Pro has it's very own heavy duty protective case. The laptop largely sits on moved at my workstation for the first time in weeks I took it to a café, and when I closed the heavy duty case after a couple hours of working, the thin fabric strap folded in between the display and keyboard, as I gently lowered the laptop lid. When I got home, there was a crack inside the display, and the display will not light up beyond an extremely faint ghost of its gui.

In California a class action lawsuit brought to Apple lead them to pay customers money back which they had spent to repair cracked displays on the M1 and M2 chip MacBook Air and MacBook Pro's.
 There is currently not away in Texas for customers to receive this type of justice.

The bottom line is, it is a misnomer to call this machine, a laptop, a portable computer. If you are looking for a portable computer, do not purchase one of these.
