TLDR: Secret Romance in the C-Suite

TLDR: I had an excessively challenging interview at Maang

Because these companies receive a high volume of job applications, they believe that difficult interview questions is the key to identifying the most skilled candidate.

The issue lies in the fact that they pose theoretical or puzzles those bear no relevance to the actual skillset required. These questions may involve tasks such as reversing a binary tree, performing linked list operations, or solving complex logic problems.

TLDR: Soft layoffs

Stay away from #fidelityinvestments . Here’s my experience working here and hoping to save others from the same career detour. Reasons why it sucks:

1) silent layoffs- I’ve noticed pip behavior such as what goes on in big tech without big tech pay
2) speaking of pay it sucks- if you don’t make it to full vesting of 401k and other benefits (6 years) you’re being paid the same as working in a government or university job
3) wlb sucks - a week ago I worked a 17 hour day and worked the weekend before that supporting an install may have to work the week after thanksgiving supporting another install
4) lots of Indians - they come in 3 flavors here . Been here awhile, h1b, and off-shore. The former uses the later two and all flavors push non-Indians out.
5) not a technology company although they’re trying -Old tech like mainframe and broken agile implementation which they use to track your story points basically

I could go on but that should be enough reasons for most. All factors combine to form a sweatshop like environment

TLDR:  Shopify corporate culture

Oh where do I start…. biggest one for me is that the culture is dead, all of the things Shopify was known for in the work culture is gone. Then we had 2 layoffs and it appears we’re going through a silent layoff now. The team atmosphere is gone, it’s not a call of duty free for all

TLDR: Macbook pro M1 and M2 chip laptops too fragile to be laptop

The customer service representative gaslit me at the Apple store last week. When I have been researching the numerous, in the thousands, complaints about the very situation I am in.

My six month old 16 inch MacBook Pro has it's very own heavy duty protective case. The laptop largely sits on moved at my workstation for the first time in weeks I took it to a café, and when I closed the heavy duty case after a couple hours of working, the thin fabric strap folded in between the display and keyboard, as I gently lowered the laptop lid. When I got home, there was a crack inside the display, and the display will not light up beyond an extremely faint ghost of its gui.

In California a class action lawsuit brought to Apple lead them to pay customers money back which they had spent to repair cracked displays on the M1 and M2 chip MacBook Air and MacBook Pro's.
 There is currently not away in Texas for customers to receive this type of justice.

The bottom line is, it is a misnomer to call this machine, a laptop, a portable computer. If you are looking for a portable computer, do not purchase one of these.

TLDR: Companies you don't want to work for.

Slate sent ballots to a wide range of journalists, scholars, advocates, and others who have been thinking critically about technology for years. We asked them to tell us which tech companies they are most concerned about, and we let them decide for themselves what counts as “concerning.” We told them to define the category of technology companies as narrowly or broadly as they liked, which is how, say, Exxon Mobil made the list. Each respondent ranked as many as 10 companies—subsidiaries counted as part of parent corporations—with more points going to the choices they placed at the top. Then we added up their votes and got this.

What did we find? While the major U.S. tech companies topped the vote—read on to find out which came in at No. 1—our respondents are deeply concerned about foreign companies dabbling in surveillance and A.I., as well as the domestic gunners that power the data-broker business. No one thinks Twitter is the worst thing that could happen to a planet, but a lot of people worry about it a little. Companies with the potential to do harm can be as distressing as those with long records of producing it. Privacy people care a lot about misinformation, but misinformation people might not be so worried about privacy. Almost everyone distrusts Peter Thiel. And some people don’t have a problem with Amazon or Apple or even Facebook at all—which is why we included dissents for many of the top companies on our list.

We hope you’ll argue over this attempt at finding consensus, make your own mental list, and decide which concerns expressed here are too mild, totally overblown, or exactly right.

TLDR: Sam Altman's job is available at OpenAI!

Sam Altman, one of the most influential leaders in the burgeoning AI industry, is leaving OpenAI, the company he helped start in 2015 and led as CEO.

The surprise news, announced Friday afternoon, comes just a few weeks after Altman led OpenAI’s first developer day, sharing the stage with Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, a key OpenAI partner that has poured billions into the company.

In a statement, OpenAI said Altman “was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.”

“The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI,” the company said.

OpenAI CTO Mira Murati will serve as interim CEO.

Greg Brockman, who helped start the company with Altman, is stepping down as chairman of the board but will remain in his role at OpenAI reporting to the CEO.

“We are grateful for Sam’s many contributions to the founding and growth of OpenAI,” the company said. “At the same time, we believe new leadership is necessary as we move forward.”
